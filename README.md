# Automation-Rest-Assured

**Project Overview**

This repository contains API tests for Restful Booker Platform APIs using Postman and REST-assured (Java) - https://automationintesting.online. The Postman collections were initially developed for exploring the API and validating key endpoints, and now serve as a lightweight and fast-check tool alongside the main REST-Assured test suite.
